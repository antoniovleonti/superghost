# superghost-workspace

todo (demo / learn how):
* list of games for index page (& list of players for in-game); really just learn how to list things in html
* regular client pinging to stay connected to the game
* delete games when no players are in them
* timer for players adding letters to word
* DBs?? (necessary? unnecessary?)
