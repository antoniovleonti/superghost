# superghost-workspace

todo (demo / learn how):
* modal in client asking for continuation (for use when someone challenges your
  continuation) <i>[doing]</i>
* regular client pinging to stay connected to the server (staying connected to
  the server means not deleting your cookie)
* delete games when no players are in them
* timer for players adding letters to word
* DBs?? (necessary? unnecessary?)
