# superghost-workspace

todo (demos / learn how):
* verify words by sending http requests to `api.dictionaryapi.dev` (DONE!)
* modal in client asking for continuation (for use when someone challenges your
  continuation)
* regular client pinging to stay connected to the server (staying connected to
  the server means not deleting your cookie)
* delete games when no players are in them
* timer for players adding letters to word
* DBs?? (necessary? unnecessary?)
