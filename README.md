# superghost-workspace

todo (demo / learn how):
* programmatic lists in html / JS (for use in list of games, list of players)
* regular client pinging to stay connected to the game
* delete games when no players are in them
* timer for players adding letters to word
* DBs?? (necessary? unnecessary?)
